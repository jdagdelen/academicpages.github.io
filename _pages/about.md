About John
======

John joined the Persson group shortly before earning his undergraduate degree in Materials Science from UC Berkeley in 2016. Now, as a PhD student John is using natural language processing and other statistical learning techniques to discover materials with extraordinary properties. When asked about the meaning of life, his team’s AI trained on materials science research papers responded, “the meaning of life is to prepare stable, sustainable materials that can function well.”
