John Dagdelen is a Graudate Student Researcher in [Professor Kristin Persson's](perssongroup.lbl.gov) group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory/UC Berkeley.

About John
======

John joined the Persson group shortly before earning his undergraduate degree in Materials Science from UC Berkeley in 2016. Now, as a PhD student John is using natural language processing and other statistical learning techniques to discover materials with extraordinary properties. When asked about the meaning of life, his team’s AI trained on materials science research papers responded, “the meaning of life is to prepare stable, sustainable materials that can function well.” [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
